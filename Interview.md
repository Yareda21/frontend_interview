# tooling 

- Webpack 
* is a utility that takes all your project’s files—JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, etc.—and combines them into optimized bundles for use in the browser. These tools can also transform, compress, and optimize your code.

## The main purposes of bundling tools:

  - Combine multiple files into one or a few files (to reduce HTTP requests).

  - Transpile newer syntax (e.g., ES6+ → ES5).

  - Convert JSX, TypeScript, SCSS, etc., to browser-compatible code.

  - Optimize assets for performance (minification, compression, tree-shaking).

## Examples of bundlers:

 - Webpack (most common and highly configurable)

 - Vite (modern, fast, opinionated alternative)

 - Parcel (zero-config bundler)

 - Rollup (great for libraries)
